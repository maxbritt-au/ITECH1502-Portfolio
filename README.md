# 👋 Hello, I'm Max

🎓 I’m a **university student** currently completing **Cybersecurity Fundamentals**, developing hands-on experience in **digital forensics**, **incident response**, and **log analysis**.  
💡 My long-term goal is to become a **Tier 1 SOC Analyst**, contributing to threat detection, response, and continuous improvement of security operations.

---

## 🎯 Objective

My goal is to apply my growing knowledge of cybersecurity concepts in **real-world defensive operations**.  
Through structured learning and practical labs, I aim to strengthen my ability to:

- Analyse logs and detect unauthorized access  
- Investigate and document incidents  
- Respond to security events using systematic methodologies

## 🧩 Featured Project – [🔍 Brutus Lab (DFIR Investigation)](https://github.com/maxbritt-au/Brutus-Lab)

The **Brutus Lab** is a practical cybersecurity investigation completed through **HackTheBox**.  
I analysed **Linux system logs** (`auth.log` and `wtmp`) to identify unauthorized SSH access, trace attacker activity, and convert timestamps into UTC to build a complete attack timeline.

**Key Outcomes**
- 🧾 Identified attacker IP and confirmed manual root login  
- 🕓 Correlated authentication and session logs into a clear timeline  
- 🧩 Demonstrated forensic investigation aligned with NIST CSF “Detect” and “Respond” functions  
- 🧠 Produced a professional report summarizing the full investigation and recommendations

## 🧭 What I’m Currently Learning

- Fundamentals of **incident response** and **threat intelligence**  
- Core SOC tools and workflows for **alert triage and log correlation**  
- **Python scripting** for automation in forensic analysis
